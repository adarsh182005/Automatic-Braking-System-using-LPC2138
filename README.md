# ðŸš— Automatic Braking System using LPC2138

This project implements an **Automatic Braking System** using the **LPC2138 ARM7 microcontroller**. It uses an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect obstacles and applies **PWM-based motor control** for safe, real-time braking.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
- Distance-based braking logic (Safe, Warning, Danger zones)
- Emergency stop in critical conditions
- Real-time LCD feedback
- PWM motor speed control using L298 driver

### ðŸ§  How It Works:
The system continuously monitors the distance to obstacles. Based on this, it adjusts the motor speed:
- **>100 cm**: Full speed
- **50â€“100 cm**: Speed decreases as obstacle nears
- **<50 cm**: Immediate stop with crash warning

### ðŸ›  Components Used:
- LPC2138 (ARM7)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- L298 Motor Driver
- DC Motor
- 16x2 LCD Display

### ðŸ”§ Applications:
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Robotics Safety Systems
- Smart Parking & AGVs

### ðŸ§ª Simulation:
